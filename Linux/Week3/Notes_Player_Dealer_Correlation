The analysis of the player win/loss data showed that there was one player that played everyday during a loss.
The player's name was Mylie Schmidt and she played a total of 13 days.

The analysis of the dealer schedule data showed that there was one roulette dealer that managed the table 
during a loss. The dealer's name was Billy Jones. Any day that the casino incurred losses on the roulette
table, Billy Jones was the dealer. 

Based on that information, it is highly plausible that Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are colluding to scam 
Lucky Duck out of thousands of dollars.
