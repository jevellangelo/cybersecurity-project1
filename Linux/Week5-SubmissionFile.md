### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
    ```
        tar xvvf TarDocs.tar ~/Projects
    ```
2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
    ```
        tar --exclude "TarDocs/Documents/Java/*" --exclude "TarDocs/Documents/Java" -cvf Javaless_Doc.tar TarDocs
    ```
3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
    ```
        tar -tvf Javaless_Doc.tar | grep Java
    ```
**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
    ```
        sudo tar --listed-incremental=snapshot.file -cvvzf logs_backup_tar.gz /var/log
    ```
#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
    > The reason you wouldn't use `-x` with `-c` is because their functions are opposite of each other

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
    ```
        0 6 * * 3 sudo tar -cvvzf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log >/dev/null 2>&1
    ```
---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
    ```
        mkdir ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        # Free memory output to a free_mem.txt file
        free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

        # Disk usage output to a disk_usage.txt file
        du -h  > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

        # List open files to a open_list.txt file
        lsof /dev/null > ~/backups/openlist/openlist.txt

        # Free disk space to a free_disk.txt file
        df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
    ```
        chmod +x system.sh 
    ```
**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
    ```
        cat ~/backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}/*.txt
    ```
**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
    ```
        sudo cp system.sh /etc/cron.weekly/
    ```
---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
        /var/log/auth.log {
            weekly
            rotate 7
            notifempty
            compress
            delaycompress
            missingok
            endscript
        }

    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
    ```
        systemctl status auditd.service 
    ```
2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
        max_log_file = 35
        num_logs = 7
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
        -w /etc/shadow -p wra -k hashpass_audit
        -w /etc/passwd -p wra -k userpass_audit
        -w /var/log/auth.log -p wra -k authlog_audit
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:
    ```
        sudo systemctl restart auditd.service 
    ```
5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
    ```
        sudo auditctl -l
    ```
6. Command to produce an audit report:
    ```
        sudo aureport
    ```
7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:
    ```
        sudo aureport -m
8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:
    ```
        sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron
    ```
9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:
    ```
        sudo auditctl -l
    ```

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
    ```
        journalctl -b -p "emerg".."err"
    ```
1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
    ```
        journalctl -b | wc -c
    ```
1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:
    ```
        journalctl --vacuum-files=2
    ```

1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
    ```
        journalctl -p 0..2 > /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
    ```
1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
        0 0 * * * journalctl -p 0..2 >/dev/null 2>&1
    ```
